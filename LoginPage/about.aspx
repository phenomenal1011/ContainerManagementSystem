Freighter Travel was established in 1993 by two enthusiastic world travellers who saw a wonderful travel opportunity going largely unnoticed by the travelling public for lack of a professional promotion and booking agency.

Pooling experience and resources, the two seasoned adventurers created a company that specializes in booking travel for anyone, from anywhere, to anywhere via cargo carrying, ocean going vessels.

They started a register of passenger carrying cargo ships which now lists almost every such vessel and shipping line in the world, and is the only known register of its’ kind. This allows them to provide a unique and worldwide service.

Now, via the Internet, it is possible for you to enquire about and arrange the adventure of a lifetime.

Freighter Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hawkes Bay Travel Centre, a fully licensed IATA Travel Agency.
