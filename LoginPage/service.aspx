Sailing  as a passenger on a cargo vessel is a unique experience: all the rules that you usually hear on a cruise ship – usually do not apply,

You are welcome on the bridge at any time – just be respectful of the Officers.

If you want to sit on the bow and watch the world go by – no problem, with the merchant marine you have the time to  savor the tranquility and elements of the ocean without the hustle and bustle of a cruise ship.

You get all the benefits of excellent accommodation and meals; the opportunity to get to know the crew, the workings of the ship; and plenty of time to relax and unwind – perhaps write that book you have been promising yourself.

Some cargo ships have a swimming pool and gymnasium which are shared with the ship’s crew and/or officers.
